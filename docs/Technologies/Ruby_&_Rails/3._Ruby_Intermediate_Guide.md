# CodigoDelSur's intermediate guide to Ruby.

This guide is intended for those *Ruby developers* that already have practice programming on *Ruby* and have already read [CodigoDelSur's ruby beginners guide](/Technologies/Ruby_&_Rails/Ruby_Beginners_Guide.md)

The goal of this guide is to give to those that have already worked with *Ruby* a better understanding of it, thus improving their overall code quality.
