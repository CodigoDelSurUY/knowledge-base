# CodigoDelSur's beginners guide to Ruby.

If you have already worked or experienced with *Object Oriented Programming* and decided it was time to add Ruby to your portfolio, then this guide is for you.
In here you will find links to useful tutorials about Ruby, what it is and how it works.

In behalf of the CodigoDelSur staff we like to wish you a nice journey into the world of Ruby.

## First steps

[Here](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/ruby/) you will find the basic concepts of Ruby, the very first step in your journey to becoming an almighty Ruby developer.

For another quick jump, you may also find interesting [this](http://tryruby.org/) site which allows you to play around with the first set of instructions for the Ruby language.

To keep pace, you can also check out [this](http://www.codesdope.com/) tutorial for a more detailed introduction on the most important topics and concepts.

## Going further

You probably feel more comfortable by learning something new with some type of material more than others and this shouldn't be the exception. We encourage you to take the route that fits better this training stage. Below you'll find links to the different resources that we have selected for you.
