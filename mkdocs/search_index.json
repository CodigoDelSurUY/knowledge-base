            "text": "What is Agile?\n\n\n\n\nAgile is a structured and iterative approach to project management and product development, most commonly used for software. It gives you the ability to respond to change without going off the rails, which is good news for any team. When a team transitions to agile from traditional software development, such as waterfall, they should remember that it is a cultural and technical philosophy, not just a set of ceremonies.\n- \natlassian.com\n\n\n\n\nThere are serveral Agile methodologies, the most popular are: Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming, Crystal, Dynamic Systems Development Method and Feature-Driven Development. You can learn more about all this different methodologies by entering this \nlink\n. \n\n\nAgile Manifesto\n\n\nThe term agile came form the Agile Manifesto. This Manifesto was created when seventeen well-known software development figures met together to discuss about the issues that development methods were having. On that meeting they redacted \n4 Values and 12 Principles\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nScrum\n\n\nAt CodigoDelSur we mostly use \nScrum\n. When we started using this agile methodology, it gave us really good results in our projects. We adopted scrum with a step by step process: we first pick some of the scrum elements that we thought that will be more useful for us. For example, on some projects we started with the daily standup and the sprint retrospective meeting, and then we continue  adding more Srcum ceremonies and elements.   \n\n\nYou can get a quick picture of this methodology by watching thid video:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to know a little bit more about the roles, ceremonies and components of scrum you can check this links:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum\n\n\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/agile/ceremonies\n\n\nhttps://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/backlog-grooming/\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we love all the Scrum components, we are conscious that Scrum is just a framework, some elements might not apply to all projects. Furthermore, some projects, given its specific nature, might not event be appropriate for Scrum methodology. We believe that beyond the Scrum framework the key value on this agile methodology is in the concepts and the philosophy that the framework helps you to develop. Concepts like continuous improvement, business-value-oriented features, adaptation to changes, client integration on the development process, etc.   \n\n\nInternal Quality\n\n\nIn contrast to other methodologies like Extreme Programming, Scrum doesn't specify technical practices to tackle products internal quality, it is mainly centered on project management techniques. We strongly believe that the software internal quality is something that should not be negotiable. If you don't pay attention to the internal quality of your products, you will end soon fighting with your software code to add functionalities and fixing bugs, and this will decrease drastically the productivity of the team. \n\n\nWe have learned that the technical practices that monitors and take care of the internal quality may vary between projects and technologies but here we will mention some common practices that can be applied on every project:\n\n\nTechnical debt\n is a metaphor that compares the poor quality code of a software project with a financial debt. Is crucial to know that all projects will have at least a minimum technical debt, it will appear for different reasons: Human error, misunderstanding, short time lapse, features changes, etc. Is our responsibility to track and try to pay off that debt. What we usually do in our projects is to have a separate backlog were we can add all the technical debt items that we found in the code. This keep us conscious of the debt. On every sprint planning we analyze which items on the technical debt backlog can be tacked on that sprint.\n\n\nDefinition of Done\n is a crucial concept, it consists in a list of activities added to the User Stories (writing code, coding comments, unit testing, integration testing, release notes, design documents, etc.). In order to consider a Task done all the items on the list must be done. This simple activity improves the quality on the software development process. The fact that the whole team stablish a \"done criteria\", removes a lot of doubts at the moment to the determine the acceptance level of a certain task. Also is very important that the tasks must be well described and must have a clear output so the developers involve on that task doesn't have missunderstanding errors. \n\n\nContinuous Integration\n is a well know practice that many developer teams had acquired. Basically Continuous Integration consist in execute plenty frequently an automated integration procedure (download app source, build app, execute tests, etc.) in order to rapidly detect errors and always ensure a deliverable build. Here at CodigoDelSur we are really happy with the results of this practice, it has been super helpful to anticipate issues on our apps.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2008/september/what-is-definition-of-done-(dod)\n\n\nhttps://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlaccidScrum.html\n\n\nhttps://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html\n\n\nhttps://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum",

Here at \nCodigoDelSur\n we mostly use cocoapods. Using cocoapods, the dependencies are listed in a text file named Podfile. To initialize the project you just need to go to the Xcode project folder and run on a terminal the command \n$ pod init\n, this will create the podfile setup. Once the project has the podfile with the dependency libraries listed inside you can install them by typing the command \n$ pod intall\n. After the command finishes you can open the generated workspace to start coding. \n\n\nDistribution tools\n\n\nFor distribute our app to our clients and test teams we use the next platforms:\n\n\n\n\nHockeyapp\n Is a complete platform for distributing app builds, it provides a lot of useful feature like feedback, metrics and crash reporting.  \n\n\nCrashlytics\n Another nice distribution tool. Originally it was a crash reporting tool and now is part of the \nFabric\n platform and also provides a distribution system. \n\n\nTestflight\n The apple distribution system, is integrated with \nXcode\n and it can allow the app to be tested by up to 2,000 testers by only having their emails.\n\n\nDiawi\n is a very straight forward platform you just drag and drop the ipa file and it will return you the url where the users can download it.\n\n\n\n\nCode Style\n\n\nObjective-C Code Style\n\n\nOn what concerns about naming classes, variables and methods we follow the \nApple's Coding Guidelines for Cocoa\n. Regarding code style we have created an uncrustify configuration file to automatically apply our code style. On this \nlink\n you can access to it.\nHere you can see some guides that we based from: \n\n\n\n\nNew York Times\n\n\nGitHub\n\n\nCocoaDevCentral\n\n\nWikimedia\n\n\nRaywenderlich.com Objective-C style guide\n\n\n\n\nSwift Code Style\n\n\n\n\nThe Official raywenderlich.com Swift Style Guide\n\n\nLinkedIn's Swift Style Guide\n\n\n\n\nCommenting code\n\n\nWhen commenting our code we like to comments our header's using the \nHeaderDoc\n notation. Usually we use the \n/** - */\n notation to start a documentation block. HeaderDoc works with a series of tags. These tags can be grouped into two categories: \nTop-level tags\n describe the type of declaration that and \nSecond-Level Tags\n that adds additional information about the declaration. Our preferred tags are:\n\n\nTop-Level Tags\n\n\n\n\n@class\n Used to point the starting point of a documentation block regarding a class. \n\n\n@protocol\n Just like the above, just for protocols.\n\n\n\n\nSecond-Level Tags\n\n\n\n\n@brief\n Used to write a short description about the method, property, class, file, struct, or enum you\u2019re documenting. No line breaks are allowed. \n\n\n@discussion\n Used to write a thorough description. You can add line breaks if needed.\n\n\n@param\n With this you can describe a parameter of a method or function. You can have multiple such tags.\n\n\n@return\n Used to specify the return value of a method or function.\n\n\n\n\nBy using this notation, you can build easily html documentation using tools like \njazzy\n, \nDoxygen\n and \nHeaderDoc\n.\nOn this \nlink\n you can check an interesting article describing those tools.\n\n\nAlso we use the \npragma mark\n directive in all of our classes. The \npragma mark\n directive helps to organize the methods of a class making the code more clean and easy to read. It help us to separate methods and group them by delegates implementations, IBAction, etc.\n\n\nLibraries\n\n\nHere is the list of our most used iOS libraries:\n\n\n\n\nAFNetworking\n This is the networking framework that we mostly use. Its really nice, and it really makes life a little bit easy. \n\n\nAlamofire\n The networking framework we use for swift projects..\n\n\nCrashlytics\n is the crash reporting to that we use here.\n\n\nCocoaLumberjack\n Its a logging framework that helps us to organize and manage our app's console logs. \n\n\nFLEX\n An in-app debugging and exploration tool for iOS.\n\n\nReachability\n A really simple but good way to evaluate host availability is using this library.\n\n\nSVProgressHUD\n Provides us a easy way to implement loading alert while waiting for something.\n\n\n\n\nOther nice libraries\n\n\n\n\nPusher\n Is a library that we have used to establish socket communication with the backend.\n\n\nCharts\n Help us when we want to display awesome charts.\n\n\nMapbox\n Provide us ablilty to show really nice maps in our iOS apps.\n\n\n\n\nOn the links below you can find really complete list of iOS libraries:\n\n\n\n\nAwesome-ios\n\n\nAwesome-ios-ui",

Here we are going to describe our git flow that we have been using in many projects and worked really well.\n\n\nWe can distinct between two types of branches: the \nmain branches\n and the \nsupporting branches\n. The main branches are branches that should never be deleted, these branches represents every stage of the code. The supporting branches always have a limited life time, these branches are created to develope a feature, fixing a bug ,etc.\n\n\nImportant:\n Main branches should be protected branches and should require pull request reviews before merging.\n\n\nMain branches\n\n\ndevelopment\n Contains all the latest features developed by the team. This is an unstable branch, baisically is constantly recibing features from the developers.\n\n\nqa_testing\n This branch is where the QA team do theris tests. It contains all the features that will be released to the client or beta testers.\n\n\nstage\n Holds the latest released version to the client or beta testers. This an stable branch.\n\n\nmaster\n Holds the App Store versions. As this is our production branch it must be stable.\n\n\nSupporting Branches\n\n\nfeature\n Every time a developer starts a feature, a new branch starting from development must be created. Once the developer finish the feature  and ends testing it, the feature is ready to be merged into development.\nThese branches should be named as:\nfeature/[taskid]_taskname\n\n\nepic\n Baiscially this is a feature branch that contains an epic feature. Epic features baisically are big features that should have an on/off mechanism inside the code(toggle feature). The behaiviour is exact the same as the feature branch and should be named as:\nepic/[taskid]_taskname\n\n\nbug\n Every time the QA team reports a bug, or the developer team detects one, that bug must be treated on a bug branch. These branches must always  be started from the qa_testing branch.\nThese branches should be named as:\nbug/[taskid]_taskname\n\n\nhotfix\n Every time a bug is discovered on stage or on production we should cr\u00e9ate a hotfix branch to fix this issue. The branch starts from stage or master depending on where the bug was detected.\nThese branches should be named as:\nhotfix/[taskid]_taskname\nMerges\n\n\nMain Branches Merges\n\n\ndeveloper -\n qa_testing\n Once the features that will be added to the build are completed and merged with development, we can merge with qa_testing so then the QA team can test the build.\n\n\nqa_testing -\n stage\n Once the QA team review the build and all the bugs fund were resolved, we can merge from qa_testing to stage.\n\n\nstage -\n master\n Once the Beta testers and the client give us the OK to go to production, we are ready to upload the app to the appstore and this will require to  merge stage with master.\n\n\nmaster -\n stage\n Every hotfix fixed on master must be merged in stage.\n\n\nstage  -\n qa_testing\n Every hotfix fixed on stage or any aditional code on stage must be merged in qa_testing.\n\n\nqa_testing -\n developer\n Every bug fixed on qa_testing or any aditional code on qa_testing must be merged on developer.\n\n\nSupporting Branches Merges\n\n\nFeature -\n developer\n Once a developer finish implementing a task and finish testing that feature, he must merge that feature on development.\n\n\nEpic -\n developer\n Once a developer finish implementing an epic feature and finish testing it, he must merge that feature on development.\n\n\nBug -\n qa_testing\n Once a developer finish fixing a bug detected on qa_testing he must merge that fix on qa_testing.\n\n\nHotfix -\n Stable branch (stage or master)\n Once a developer finish fixing a bug detected on a stable branch he must merge that fix on that stable branch.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nhttp://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/\n.\n\n\nhttp://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html\n.\n\n\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/agile/branching\n.",
