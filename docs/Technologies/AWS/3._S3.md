# Amazon Web Services: S3
<p style="text-align: center; margin: 30px"><img width="250px" src="../img/S3_logo.png"></p>

It is very common for a project to use static files such as images, videos, style files, scripts, audios, etc. Handling this type of data ourselves can become complex for security and availability mainly. A great alternative is to use AWS S3, the storage service that offers optimised file management as well as a robust and reliable space to store our content. Its operation is similar to any file system where directories and paths are used to reference static data. The main division comes under the concept of buckets that can be used to separate environments or concepts from our application, then each bucket will have its own file system.

There are four basic operations over S3 that you can perform:

* Create a bucket
* Add an object to a bucket
* Edit an object
* Delete an object

These operations can be done directly from the Dashboard but more important you can do it from your application using the proper AWS SDK for the technology you are using.
