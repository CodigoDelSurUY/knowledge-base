#iOS Projects

We are going to describe the most essential tools that we usually use on our iOS projects. 

## Dependency management 

There are two main dependency management tools in iOS: [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) and [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Here at [CodigoDelSur](http://codigodelsur.com) we mostly use cocoapods. Using cocoapods, the dependencies are listed in a text file named Podfile. To initialize the project you just need to go to the Xcode project folder and run on a terminal the command `$ pod init`, this will create the podfile setup. Once the project has the podfile with the dependency libraries listed inside you can install them by typing the command `$ pod intall`. After the command finishes you can open the generated workspace to start coding. 

## Distribution tools

For distribute our app to our clients and test teams we use the next platforms:

* [Hockeyapp](https://hockeyapp.net) Is a complete platform for distributing app builds, it provides a lot of useful feature like feedback, metrics and crash reporting.  
* [Crashlytics](https://fabric.io/kits/android/crashlytics) Another nice distribution tool. Originally it was a crash reporting tool and now is part of the [Fabric](https://get.fabric.io) platform and also provides a distribution system. 
* [Testflight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) The apple distribution system, is integrated with [Xcode](http://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/8.2/#/dev2539d985f) and it can allow the app to be tested by up to 2,000 testers by only having their emails.
* [Diawi](https://www.diawi.com) is a very straight forward platform you just drag and drop the ipa file and it will return you the url where the users can download it.

## Code Style
### Objective-C Code Style

On what concerns about naming classes, variables and methods we follow the [Apple's Coding Guidelines for Cocoa](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/CodingGuidelines.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000146-SW1). Regarding code style we have created an uncrustify configuration file to automatically apply our code style. On this [link](https://github.com/codigodelsur/conventions-iOS/blob/master/codeStyle/uncrustify/uncrustify.cfg) you can access to it.
Here you can see some guides that we based from: 

* [New York Times](https://github.com/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/github/objective-c-conventions)
* [CocoaDevCentral](http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000082.php)
* [Wikimedia](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Team/iOS/ObjectiveCStyleGuide)
* [Raywenderlich.com Objective-C style guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/objective-c-style-guide)

### Swift Code Style

### Commenting code

When commenting our code we like to comments our header's using the [HeaderDoc](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/HeaderDoc/intro/intro.html) notation. Usually we use the `/** - */` notation to start a documentation block. HeaderDoc works with a series of tags. These tags can be grouped into two categories: **Top-level tags** describe the type of declaration that and **Second-Level Tags** that adds additional information about the declaration. Our preferred tags are:

##### Top-Level Tags

* `@class` Used to point the starting point of a documentation block regarding a class. 
* `@protocol` Just like the above, just for protocols.

##### Second-Level Tags

* `@brief` Used to write a short description about the method, property, class, file, struct, or enum youâ€™re documenting. No line breaks are allowed. 
* `@discussion` Used to write a thorough description. You can add line breaks if needed.
* `@param` With this you can describe a parameter of a method or function. You can have multiple such tags.
* `@return` Used to specify the return value of a method or function.

By using this notation, you can build easily html documentation using tools like [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy), [Doxygen](www.doxygen.org) and [HeaderDoc](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/HeaderDoc/intro/intro.html).
On this [link](http://www.appcoda.com/documenting-source-code-in-xcode/) you can check an interesting article describing those tools.

Also we use the `pragma mark` directive in all of our classes. The `pragma mark` directive helps to organize the methods of a class making the code more clean and easy to read. It help us to separate methods and group them by delegates implementations, IBAction, etc.

## Libraries

Here is the list of our most used iOS libraries:

* [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) This is the networking framework that we mostly use. Its really nice, and it really makes life a little bit easy. 
* [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) The networking framework we use for swift projects..
* [Crashlytics](https://fabric.io/kits/android/crashlytics) is the crash reporting to that we use here.
* [CocoaLumberjack](https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack) Its a logging framework that helps us to organize and manage our app's console logs. 
* [FLEX](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLEX) An in-app debugging and exploration tool for iOS.
* [Reachability](https://github.com/tonymillion/Reachability) A really simple but good way to evaluate host availability is using this library.
* [SVProgressHUD](https://github.com/codigodelsur/conventions-iOS#--socket-communication) Provides us a easy way to implement loading alert while waiting for something.

### Other nice libraries 

* [Pusher](https://pusher.com) Is a library that we have used to establish socket communication with the backend.
* [Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts) Help us when we want to display awesome charts.
* [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/ios-sdk/) Provide us ablilty to show really nice maps in our iOS apps.
