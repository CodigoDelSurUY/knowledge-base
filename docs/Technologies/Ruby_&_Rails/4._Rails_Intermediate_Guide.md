# CodigoDelSur's intermediate guide to Rails.

This guide is intended for those *Rails developers* that already have practice programming on the framework and have already read [CodigoDelSur's rails beginners guide](/Technologies/Ruby_&_Rails/Rails_Beginners_Guide.md)

The goal of this guide is to give to those that have already worked on *Rails* a better understanding of it, thus improving their overall code quality.
